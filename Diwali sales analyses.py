# # Conclusion

# Insights reveal that married women aged 26-35 years, employed in the IT, healthcare, and aviation sectors in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, display a higher propensity for purchasing products from the food, clothing, and electronics categories. This indicates a distinct consumer behavior pattern influenced by demographic factors and occupational preferences.
